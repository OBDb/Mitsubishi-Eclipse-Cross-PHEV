    description: "The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) was introduced as part of the Eclipse Cross facelift, adopting and refining the plug-in hybrid technology first deployed in the larger Outlander PHEV. Based on the refreshed Eclipse Cross with its revised exterior styling, the PHEV variant is visually distinguished by unique badging, specific wheel designs, and in some markets, exclusive color options. The sophisticated hybrid powertrain combines a 2.4-liter gasoline engine producing approximately 126 horsepower with two electric motors—a 82 hp motor at the front and a 95 hp motor at the rear—creating a unique all-wheel drive system without needing a traditional driveshaft. Total system output is approximately 188 horsepower, providing more responsive performance than the standard turbocharged model. A 13.8 kWh lithium-ion battery enables an electric-only driving range of approximately 22 miles (45 kilometers on the WLTP cycle) with a top speed of about 80 mph in EV mode. This battery can be charged using a standard household outlet, Level 2 charging station, or DC fast charging capable of an 80% charge in approximately 25 minutes. Multiple drive modes include EV Priority (using only electric power), Series Hybrid (where the engine acts as a generator), Parallel Hybrid (where both the engine and motors power the vehicle), and a Battery Save mode to maintain charge for later use. The system also offers selectable regenerative braking strength via paddle shifters. The interior features specific displays for monitoring the hybrid system's operation and energy flow, while the S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) system benefits from the precise torque control enabled by the electric motors. A unique feature is the vehicle's bi-directional charging capability, allowing it to function as a mobile power source for outdoor activities or emergency situations. The Eclipse Cross PHEV combines Mitsubishi's expertise in both SUVs and electrification, offering a more affordable entry point to plug-in hybrid technology compared to the larger Outlander PHEV while maintaining the brand's focus on all-weather capability and practicality."
